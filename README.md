# cutoff-selection

### Code for Estimating cutoff values for diagnostic tests with extreme value theory (Pugh, Fosdick, Nehring, Gallichotte, VandeWoude, and Wilson)

**data-analysis.R**: Estimates cutoffs for COVID-19 spike and RBD ELISA test data

**fit-mixture-distributions.R**: Fits mixture distributions to the COVID-19 spike and RBD ELISA test data, which are used in the simulation study

**simulation.R**: Runs a simulation study comparing the cutoff methods
